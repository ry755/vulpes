# Vulpes

**Vulpes** is a small homebrew operating system targeting 32-bit x86 computers. It is based on the zig-rewrite branch of [FennecOS](https://github.com/ry755/fennecos/tree/zig-rewrite). I decided to split it off into its own project due to it moving away from FennecOS in design. This is very WIP!
